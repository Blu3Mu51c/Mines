* HTML setup
    * Game title
    * Grid
    * Flag Amount
    * Timer
    * Winning message

Grid made using [i][j] or [i][i] where i and j are integers.

After game starts (on player click) generate limited number of mines randomly all across using math.random method.

Iterate through the 2d array and find all mines and scan each tile in contact with each mine horizontally, vertically and diagonally.

`mine.contact++;`

When tile is clicked that is in contact with a mine/mines reveal only that tile with a number & color representing the amount of mines in contact.

```
If tile === mine loser = true;
Message = You Lost;
Timer stop;

If all mines === flagged winner = true;
Message = You Won;
Timer stop;
```

reset onClick 
```
all tiles = covered;
winner = false;
loser = false;
timer = null;
```
